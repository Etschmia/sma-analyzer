# SMA Crossover Analyzer ðŸ“ˆ

This web application provides a tool to backtest and visualize the Simple Moving Average (SMA) Crossover strategy for various financial indices. The project is inspired by an interview with Oliver Baron in "ideas-magazin.de", where an AI-optimized strategy using 190- and 212-day SMAs on the DAX was discussed.

This tool allows users to configure their own SMA periods, select from major world indices, and analyze historical performance and crossover events.



## Features

* **Custom SMA Periods:** Set any two SMA lengths (e.g., 50 vs. 200) to test different strategies.
* **Selectable Indices:** Analyze major indices by using their corresponding ETFs (e.g., DAX, S&P 500, NASDAQ 100).
* **Variable Timeframes:** Choose the historical lookback period in days.
* **Interactive Charting:** Visualizes the closing price, both SMA lines, and bullish/bearish crossover events directly on the chart.
* **Persistent Settings:** Your chosen settings are saved in the browser, so they're remembered on your next visit.
